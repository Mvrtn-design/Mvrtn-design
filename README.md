- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mvrtn-design
- 👀 I'm interested in programming in different languages, highlighting C, C++ or Java among others. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning these languages and others like R , Haskell or Gams as well as some techniques such as design patterns or concurrent programming. All this and more in Computer Engineering at the URJC (Spanish University).
- 💞️ I´d like to enjoy it as much as my I can.

It is said that if you can imagine , you can code it. Let's just prove it.
